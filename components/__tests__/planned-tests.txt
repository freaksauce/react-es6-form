If the test runner had worked:

* Test that the json object is loaded in App.js, not empty and contains the necessary objects needed to build each component

* Test all components render correctly with data supplied

* Test that you cannot submit a form with empty fields using something like:

TestUtils.Simulate.click(this.refs.submit);
expect(this.refs.fullname.props.className).toEqual("error");

* Test that an individual field shows validation error on blur

TestUtils.Simulate.blur(this.refs.fullname);
expect(this.refs.fullname.props.className).toEqual("error");
